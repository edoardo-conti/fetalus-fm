    """
    A class for evaluating Intersection over Union (IoU) and other segmentation metrics.
    Source: https://github.com/sacmehta/ESPNet/blob/master/train/IOUEval.py
    This class provides methods to compute and accumulate metrics for semantic segmentation tasks,
    including overall accuracy, per-class accuracy, per-class IoU, and mean IoU (mIoU) across multiple batches.
    Attributes:
        nClasses (int): Number of classes in the segmentation task.
        overall_acc (float): Accumulated overall accuracy across batches.
        per_class_acc (np.ndarray): Accumulated per-class accuracy across batches.
        per_class_iu (np.ndarray): Accumulated per-class IoU across batches.
        mIOU (float): Accumulated mean IoU across batches.
        batchCount (int): Number of batches processed.
